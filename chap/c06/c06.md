# Chapter 6: Using the Java Library

## ArrayList Class

ArrayList is a class in the core Java library (the API).

| some methods       | description                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| add(E e)           | Appends the specified element to the end of this list    |
| remove(int index)  | Removes the element at the specified position            |
| remove(Object o)   | Removes the first occurrence of the specified element    |
| contains(Object o) | Returns true if this list contains the specified element |
| isEmpty()          | Returns true if this list contains no elements           |
| indexOf(Object o)  | Returns either the first index of the element, or -1     |
| size()             | Returns the number of elements in this list              |
| get(int index)     | Returns the element at the specified position            |

## Usage

```java
// 1. Make a list of Egg objects
ArrayList<Egg> myList = new ArrayList<Egg>();

// 2. Add some eggs to the list
Egg egg1 = new Egg();
myList.add(egg1);   //there will be egg1

// 3. Add another egg
Egg egg2 = new Egg();
myList.add(egg2);   //there will be egg1 and egg2

// 4. Find out how many things are in it
int theSize = myList.size();    //theSize == 2

// 5. Find out if it contains something
boolean isIn = myList.contains(egg1);   //isIn == true

// 6. Find out where something is
int idx = myList.indexOf(egg2); //idx == 1

// 7. Find out if it's empty
boolean empty = myList.isEmpty(); //empty == false

// 8. Remove something from it
myList.remove(egg1);    //there will only be egg2
```

## Diff ArrayList and array

- a array has to know its size at the time it's created, while a ArrayList don't need.

  ```java
  new String[2];  //Needs a size
  new ArrayList<String>();    //No size needed
  // although you can specify a size for an ArrayList.
  ```

- To put an object in a array, you must assign it to a specific location, while a ArrayList can just add it to the end.

  ```java
  String[1] = "hi";   //Needs a index
  myList.add(b);      //No index needed
  //we can also use `add(index, element)` to add an element to a specific location.
  ```

- The `[]` are used only for arrays. It's not used anywhere else in Java.

  ```java
  myList[1]
  ```

- ArrayList use something special -- parameterized types, which is added in Java 5.

  ```java
  ArrayList<String>
  //The <String> part is called a parameterized type.
  //ArrayList<String> means "a list of Strings".
  ```

## Short-Circuit Operators and Non-Short-Circuit Operators

The operators, `$$` and `||`, are called short-circuit operators. They're called short-circuit because if the first part of the expression is enough to determine the value of the whole expression, the second part won't be evaluated.

The operators, `$` and `|`, are called non-short-circuit operators. They're called non-short-circuit because they always evaluate both parts of the expression.

Both of them have the same usage as C++.

## The Java API

In the Java API, classes are grouped into packages. The ArrayList class is in the **java.util** package.

To use a class from the API, you have to indicate the *full* name of the library class you want to use, and that means package name + class name. For example, **System**(`System.out.println`), **String**, and **Math**(`Math.random`) all belong to the **java.lang** package.

The full name of the ArrayList is actually: **java.util.ArrayList**.

You have to tell Java which ArrayList you want to use. You have two options:

### IMPORT

Put an import statement at the top of your source code file:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
public class MyClass {
    //TODO
}
```

### TYPE

Type the full name everywhere in you code. Each time you use it. Everywhere you use it.

```java
// When you declare and/or instantiate it
java.util.ArrayList<Egg> myList = new java.util.ArrayList<Egg>();

// When you use it as an argument type
public void go(java.util.ArrayList<Egg> myList) {
    //TODO
}

// When you use it as a return type
public java.util.ArrayList<Egg> foo() {
    //TODO
}
```
