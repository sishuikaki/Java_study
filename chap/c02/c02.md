# Chapter 2: A Trip to Objectville

When you design a class, think about the objects that will be created from that class type. Think about:

- things the object knows, which are its **instance variables**
- things the object does, which are its **methods**

A class is a blueprint for an object.

Every object goes into a **heap**. The Java heap is called the **Garbage-Collectible Heap**. When the JVM can "see" that an object can never be used again, that object becomes eligible for garbage collection.

Any code can access a **public** and **static** method and can access a **public**, **static** and **final** variable which is actually a globally available constant.
