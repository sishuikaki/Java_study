# Chapter 1: Breaking the Surface

A boolean and an integer are not compatible types. The result of a conditional test must be a boolean.

For example:

`int x` is invalid.

```java
int x = 1;
while (x){ } //invalid
if (x){ } //invalid
```

`boolean x` is valid.

```java
boolean x = true;
while (x){ } //valid
if (x){ } //valid
```

DO NOT hit the return key until after typing the code. The code should be on the same line as the text. Let the code do its own word/line-wrapping.
